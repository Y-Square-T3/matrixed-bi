## What is Matrixed BI?

Matrixed-BI is a next-generation open data visualization platform designed to fulfill diverse enterprise data
visualization needs — including creating and managing reports, dashboards, large-screen displays, performing visual data
analysis, and building visual data applications. Developed by the original Davinci core team, Matrixed-BI is more open,
flexible, and intelligent — striving for the optimal balance between data and design.

### Design Philosophy

#### **Openness**

While BI products have matured significantly as standardized solutions, most remain closed systems — users can only
leverage built-in data sources, chart types, and visual components. We believe a data visualization platform can, within
its system boundaries, offer extensibility across multiple layers. New extensions should be installable, updatable, and
removable in a plug-and-play fashion. Thus, Matrixed-BI aims to establish a standardized *
*`Open Data Visualization Platform`** framework, emphasizing standardization and openness in the following areas:

- ***Standardized Workflow***: Based on **Source → View → Chart → Visualization**, Matrixed-BI implements a
  standardized, governed process for developing, publishing, and consuming **`Managed VizApps`** (Managed Visualization
  Applications).
- ***Standardized Interaction***: Visualizations support permission-controlled, standardized interactive features — such
  as filtering, drilling, cross-filtering, navigation, modals, sharing, downloads, scheduled delivery, etc.
- ***Standardized Plugin Architecture***: Standardized, pluggable extension interfaces or SDK specifications are
  provided at the *Source*, *Chart*, and *Visualization* layers — enabling open extension or custom development on
  demand.

#### **Integrability**

Matrixed-BI can function as a fully independent platform — but it’s not limited to that. To better support rapid
development of customized data applications, Matrixed-BI can be seamlessly integrated or embedded into third-party
systems to power their visualization layer. Through login integration, permission synchronization, data-source adapters,
visualization sharing, SDKs, and more, users can rapidly tailor solutions by extending or embedding Matrixed-BI.

#### **Augmented Analytics**

Traditional BI tools only allow exploration of existing data. Modern BI, however, emphasizes *extended insights* —
forming a complete analytical capability to not only answer *“What happened?”*, but also *“Why did it happen?”*.
Matrixed-BI provides a platform-level, extensible augmented analytics framework to support such insight generation —
transforming passive data review into active discovery.
